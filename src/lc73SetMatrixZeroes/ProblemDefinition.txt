Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[0].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1

A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?
